The primary outcome was the reduction in pain score between week 0 (BL) and week 48 (Wk48). 

The pain score was a composite measure of the mean of: pain at the assessment, and worst, least, and average pain in the last week (Pain Severity Score). 

Some participants did not arrive for their baseline appointments and therefore did not have data at week 0. These missing data were interpolated using the study site average PSS. 

Missing data at week 48 were interpolated using the baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) method.

To simplify the analysis, no hedence was paid as to whether data were available at intermediate time points between week 0 and week 48.

# Import and sort data

```{r import_data}
# Get BPI data
## BPI
bpi <- read_rds('data-cleaned/bpi.rds') %>% 
    select(ID, contains('Pain')) 

## Demographics
demo <- read_rds('data-cleaned/demographics.rds') %>% 
    select(ID, Study_site, Group)

## Join BPI and demographics
data <- demo %>% 
    left_join(bpi)

## Primary outcome
primary <- data %>% 
    select(-contains('present'))
